The `CompilerPipelineColored.drawio` file represents the XML source which generated the corresponding PNG. You can open the `.drawio` file on https://app.diagrams.net for editing and exporting to other formats.

NOTE: In the diagram, there are two places where the color of an arrow "changes". This is implemented by overlaying a differently colored arrow on top of another arrow with label text, instead of having 3 pieces: a segment, a textbox and an arrow.
